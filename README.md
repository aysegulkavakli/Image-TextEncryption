# Image-TextEncryption

Every encryption and decryption process has two aspects: the algorithm that used and the key use for the encryption and decryption. If we look at the algorithms like DES, 3DES and AES algorithms, AES is the most secure and effective one and one of the reason is the key length is more longer than the other’s key lengths which making it stronger than the other algorithms.
And this project is about the image and text, encryption and decryption using AES algorithm not for sharing image securely, just for personal secure. 

First of all, we have a window that ask the user which type of data(image or text files) they will encrypt or decrypt.

After that, when user select the type of data for example image files, second window appears that allows the user select and jpg, jpeg or png file to encrypt or decrypt a encrypted file.

Here is the visualization of selecting a file to encrypt by clicking JPG files button.

After user select a file, and click the button ‘Encrypt’ , a warning is appear; “The JPG file encryption is succesful”

How encrypted image looks when is wanted to open.

The encrypted or decrypted files are saved the computer like this.

All of the precedures above are same as for the text files except for how encrypted text file looks.
